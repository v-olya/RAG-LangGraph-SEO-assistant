description: This file provides coding guidelines for TypeScript and React projects.

Write maintainable, performant, scalable and accessible code following these rules:

- Use strict type checking
- Prefer type inference when the type is obvious
- Avoid the `any` type; use `unknown` when type is uncertain
- Never disable ESLint or TypeScript rules. Never!

- Use functional components and React hooks
- Use `useEffect` for side effects and cleanup
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Ensure accessibility with semantic HTML and ARIA attributes
- Write unit tests for components and functions
- Follow consistent naming conventions

When you need library documentation (for code generation, setup, configuration, etc.), use **Context7 MCP** to find the most relevant and up-to-date information.
